# PhoneAPI

This is not what you're expecting about this test, I really owe you an apollogy.

It is not an excuse but I couldn't have time to complete the frontend part because I had to work this weekend.

I tried to do my best.

I've created the backend side with Rest Services (Spring boot)
The project is a .jar

In the folder resouces I added the dump for the database (MySql)

Also, inside the folder resources, I've created a folder called potManCollection, in there you will find a .json, which contains the collections to test the application (You can use postman).

I really appreciate this opportunity.

Thank you very much.
